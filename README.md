# EN201_UARTLoader

In order to load music data in the FPGA, you should follow the following stages:

1. Open a terminal under Linux
2. Execute the following commands.

First, create a directory or reuse the previously created one:

```
mkdir the_en201_directory
```

Then move in this directory:

```
cd the_en201_directory
```

Clone the directory avaible on GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/blegal/EN201_UARTLoader.git
```

Then move in EN201_UARTLoader directory:

```
cd EN201_UARTLoader
```

Create the program from the source codes:

```
make
```

Program the FPGA target this the UART interface and then execute:

```
./bin/main ./data/selfie.uart
```

or

```
./bin/main ./data/soupe_au_choux.uart
```

depending on the music data you want :-)
